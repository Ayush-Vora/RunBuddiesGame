# 🏃‍♂️ Run Buddies

🎮 **A Fall Guys–Inspired Single-Player Platformer Made in Unreal Engine**

## 🧠 Project Overview
**Run Buddies** is my second game project — a solo-developed obstacle course game built using **Blueprints and C++ in Unreal Engine**. Players must survive moving platforms, rotating traps, and dodging cubes to reach the end and win!

If you fall or get hit, you'll respawn or restart, so timing and precision are everything.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧱 **Z-Axis Moving Platforms**  
  Jump across 9 platforms moving up and down in a challenging pattern.

- ❌ **Side-to-Side Moving Cubes**  
  Touching a cube resets you to the **last checkpoint**.

- 🔄 **Rotating Disc Platforms**  
  Five rotating discs that test your coordination and timing.

- ⬆️ **Rising Rotating Platform**  
  A platform that moves upward while rotating — balance is key!

- 🏁 **Victory Message**  
  Reach the final zone to see the **“You Won”** screen.

- 🕳️ **Void Fall Restart**  
  If you fall off the map, the game **restarts** from the beginning.
